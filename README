I wrote this for our own internal company purposes, but am making it
available publicly in hopes that it may be of use to others.  It is
licensed under the GPL v2 (or later).

I was wanting a way to determine whether or not a given host was up or
not, and then take a user-defined action.  uCarp and Heartbeat are great
for floating around virtual IP addresses for high-availability, but they
don't seem to have this functionality built in.  This program is written
in PHP and requires that the CLI version of PHP is installed.  I built
it on PHP 5.5, but I believe it will work down to 5.3.

This program contains two pieces to itself.  The first is the main
program pulse.php, and the second is config.php with all of the
configuration options.  This program runs as a daemon monitoring the
specified hosts, then takes actions based on one of four conditions:

- The host was up but is now down.
- The host was down but is now up.
- The host was up and is still up.
- The host was down and is still down.

The actions are defined as callback functions written in PHP (though
using PHP's exec() function, they can really be anything).

Here are the basic steps to setup:

1) Download this repository.
2) Edit config.php to suit your needs.
3) Execute "php pulse.php --daemon".

To create your callback functions, built then as regular PHP functions
in one or more files ending in ".php", and put them into their own
directory anywhere you'd like as long as pulse.php can include them.
Tell pulse where to find them in config.php, then define which function
to run when each of the above four events occur.  All of the events are
optional, so you don't have to define all of them.  But you should
define at least one, otherwise there's no point.

The config.php file is heavily commented with descriptions on how to
configure.  Reference the comments in that file for details of the
configuration options.
